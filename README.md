## Overview
A little something for the tinfoil hat crowd. Amaze your friends, confound your enemies, spread FUD far and wide or just have a good laugh.

This is just my implementation of a concept that's been around for a while. The idea is that USB charging ports in public places (airport kiosks, hotels, coffee shops, etc.) should be considered untrusted because it's possible they could contain technology that attempts to access data on mobile devices plugged in for charging. The USB Condom prevents this because it passes the power through but not the USB data lines. Just pop it on the end of any USB cable and you're practicing safe charging! From what I can tell, there are almost no documented instances of such a thing actually occurring. There might have been a [demonstration at DEF CON.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/beware-of-juice-jacking/) So mostly this is just a fun project, but hey, it can't hurt, right?

PC boards can be ordered [from OSH Park](https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/0s1QDkyq).
A bill of materials is available [at Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=3e867db098) and also in this repo.
